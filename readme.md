srtcleaner docker image
=======================

A docker image for [srtcleaner](https://pypi.org/project/srtcleaner/) tool.

CD into the folder with subs (or its parent, since it's recursive by default), and run it like:

~~~bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/files elboletaire/srtcleaner
~~~

By default runs with `-r -i -B` params, which means it will remove stuff in-place, recursively, without a backup, based on the file defined in `srtcleaner.conf`, which has a curated list of links and typical "resync by" messages.

If you want to change the params, you can overwrite them by specifying it as a command, but don't forget to append the `/files` path where it needs to explore (the volume you're mounting):

~~~bash
docker run --rm -v $PWD:/files elboletaire/srtcleaner -r /files
~~~
